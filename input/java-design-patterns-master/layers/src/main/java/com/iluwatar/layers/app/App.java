/**
 * Layers is an architectural style where software responsibilities are divided among the
 * different layers of the application.
 *
 * <p>This example demonstrates a traditional 3-layer architecture consisting of data access
 * layer, business layer and presentation layer.
 *
 * <p>The data access layer is formed of Spring Data repositories <code>CakeDao</code>,
 * <code>CakeToppingDao</code> and <code>CakeLayerDao</code>. The repositories can be used
 * for CRUD operations on cakes, cake toppings and cake layers respectively.
 *
 * <p>The business layer is built on top of the data access layer. <code>CakeBakingService</code>
 * offers methods to retrieve available cake toppings and cake layers and baked cakes. Also the
 * service is used to create new cakes out of cake toppings and cake layers.
 *
 * <p>The presentation layer is built on the business layer and in this example it simply lists
 * the cakes that have been baked.
 *
 * <p>We have applied so called strict layering which means that the layers can only access the
 * classes directly beneath them. This leads the solution to create an additional set of DTOs
 * ( <code>CakeInfo</code>, <code>CakeToppingInfo</code>, <code>CakeLayerInfo</code>) to translate
 * data between layers. In other words, <code>CakeBakingService</code> cannot return entities
 * ( <code>Cake</code>, <code>CakeTopping</code>, <code>CakeLayer</code>) directly since these
 * reside on data access layer but instead translates these into business layer DTOs
 * (<code>CakeInfo</code>, <code>CakeToppingInfo</code>, <code>CakeLayerInfo</code>) and returns
 * them instead. This way the presentation layer does not have any knowledge of other layers than
 * the business layer and thus is not affected by changes to them.
