## Intent
The Leader/Followers pattern provides a concurrency model where multiple 
threads can efficiently de-multiplex events and dispatch event handlers 
that process I/O handles shared by the threads.

## Class diagram

## Applicability
Use Leader-Followers pattern when

* multiple threads take turns sharing a set of event sources in order to detect, de-multiplex, dispatch and process service requests that occur on the event sources.
