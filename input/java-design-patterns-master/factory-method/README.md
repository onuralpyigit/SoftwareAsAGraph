## Also known as

Virtual Constructor

## Intent

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

## Explanation

Real-world example

> Blacksmith manufactures weapons. Elves require Elvish weapons and orcs require Orcish weapons. 
> Depending on the customer at hand the right type of blacksmith is summoned.

In plain words

> It provides a way to delegate the instantiation logic to child classes.

Wikipedia says

> In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory 
> methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of 
> the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method 
> — either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base 
> class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor.

 **Programmatic Example**

Taking our blacksmith example above. First of all, we have a `Blacksmith` interface and some 
implementations for it:

```java
public interface Blacksmith {
  Weapon manufactureWeapon(WeaponType weaponType);
}

public class ElfBlacksmith implements Blacksmith {
  public Weapon manufactureWeapon(WeaponType weaponType) {
    return ELFARSENAL.get(weaponType);
  }
}

public class OrcBlacksmith implements Blacksmith {
  public Weapon manufactureWeapon(WeaponType weaponType) {
    return ORCARSENAL.get(weaponType);
  }
}
```

When the customers come, the correct type of blacksmith is summoned and requested weapons are 
manufactured:

```java
Blacksmith blacksmith = new OrcBlacksmith();
Weapon weapon = blacksmith.manufactureWeapon(WeaponType.SPEAR);
LOGGER.info("{} manufactured {}", blacksmith, weapon);
weapon = blacksmith.manufactureWeapon(WeaponType.AXE);
LOGGER.info("{} manufactured {}", blacksmith, weapon);

blacksmith = new ElfBlacksmith();
weapon = blacksmith.manufactureWeapon(WeaponType.SPEAR);
LOGGER.info("{} manufactured {}", blacksmith, weapon);
weapon = blacksmith.manufactureWeapon(WeaponType.AXE);
LOGGER.info("{} manufactured {}", blacksmith, weapon);
```

Program output:
```
The orc blacksmith manufactured an orcish spear
The orc blacksmith manufactured an orcish axe
The elf blacksmith manufactured an elven spear
The elf blacksmith manufactured an elven axe
```

## Applicability

Use the Factory Method pattern when:

* Class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create.
* Class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
* Classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses, and you want to localize the 
knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate.
