## Also known as

Surrogate

## Intent

Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

## Explanation

Real-world example

> Imagine a tower where the local wizards go to study their spells. The ivory tower can only be 
> accessed through a proxy which ensures that only the first three wizards can enter. Here the proxy 
> represents the functionality of the tower and adds access control to it.

In plain words

> Using the proxy pattern, a class represents the functionality of another class.

Wikipedia says

> A proxy, in its most general form, is a class functioning as an interface to something else. 
> A proxy is a wrapper or agent object that is being called by the client to access the real serving 
> object behind the scenes. Use of the proxy can simply be forwarding to the real object, or can 
> provide additional logic. In the proxy extra functionality can be provided, for example caching 
> when operations on the real object are resource intensive, or checking preconditions before 
> operations on the real object are invoked.

**Programmatic Example**

Taking our wizard tower example from above. Firstly we have the `WizardTower` interface and the 
`IvoryTower` class.

```java
public interface WizardTower {

  void enter(Wizard wizard);
}

@Slf4j
public class IvoryTower implements WizardTower {

  public void enter(Wizard wizard) {
    LOGGER.info("{} enters the tower.", wizard);
  }

}
```

Then a simple `Wizard` class.

```java
public class Wizard {

  private final String name;

  public Wizard(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return name;
  }
}
```

Then we have the `WizardTowerProxy` to add access control to `WizardTower`.

```java
@Slf4j
public class WizardTowerProxy implements WizardTower {

  private static final int NUM_WIZARDS_ALLOWED = 3;

  private int numWizards;

  private final WizardTower tower;

  public WizardTowerProxy(WizardTower tower) {
    this.tower = tower;
  }

  @Override
  public void enter(Wizard wizard) {
    if (numWizards < NUM_WIZARDS_ALLOWED) {
      tower.enter(wizard);
      numWizards++;
    } else {
      LOGGER.info("{} is not allowed to enter!", wizard);
    }
  }
}
```

And here is the tower entering scenario.

```java
var proxy = new WizardTowerProxy(new IvoryTower());
proxy.enter(new Wizard("Red wizard"));
proxy.enter(new Wizard("White wizard"));
proxy.enter(new Wizard("Black wizard"));
proxy.enter(new Wizard("Green wizard"));
proxy.enter(new Wizard("Brown wizard"));
```

Program output:

```
Red wizard enters the tower.
White wizard enters the tower.
Black wizard enters the tower.
Green wizard is not allowed to enter!
Brown wizard is not allowed to enter!
```

## Applicability

Proxy is applicable whenever there is a need for a more versatile or sophisticated reference to an 
object than a simple pointer. Here are several common situations in which the Proxy pattern is 
applicable.

* Remote proxy provides a local representative for an object in a different address space.
* Virtual proxy creates expensive objects on demand.
* Protection proxy controls access to the original object. Protection proxies are useful when 
objects should have different access rights.

Typically, the proxy pattern is used to

* Control access to another object
* Lazy initialization
* Implement logging
* Facilitate network connection
* Count references to an object
