Wrapper

## Intent

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible 
alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## Explanation

Real-world example

> There is an angry troll living in the nearby hills. Usually, it goes bare-handed but sometimes it 
> has a weapon. To arm the troll it's not necessary to create a new troll but to decorate it 
> dynamically with a suitable weapon.

In plain words

> Decorator pattern lets you dynamically change the behavior of an object at run time by wrapping 
> them in an object of a decorator class.

Wikipedia says

> In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to 
> be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior 
> of other objects from the same class. The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the 
> Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with 
> unique areas of concern as well as to the Open-Closed Principle, by allowing the functionality 
> of a class to be extended without being modified.

**Programmatic Example**

Let's take the troll example. First of all we have a `SimpleTroll` implementing the `Troll` 
interface:

```java
public interface Troll {
  void attack();
  int getAttackPower();
  void fleeBattle();
}

@Slf4j
public class SimpleTroll implements Troll {

  @Override
  public void attack() {
    LOGGER.info("The troll tries to grab you!");
  }

  @Override
  public int getAttackPower() {
    return 10;
  }

  @Override
  public void fleeBattle() {
    LOGGER.info("The troll shrieks in horror and runs away!");
  }
}
```

Next, we want to add a club for the troll. We can do it dynamically by using a decorator:

```java
@Slf4j
public class ClubbedTroll implements Troll {

  private final Troll decorated;

  public ClubbedTroll(Troll decorated) {
    this.decorated = decorated;
  }

  @Override
  public void attack() {
    decorated.attack();
    LOGGER.info("The troll swings at you with a club!");
  }

  @Override
  public int getAttackPower() {
    return decorated.getAttackPower() + 10;
  }

  @Override
  public void fleeBattle() {
    decorated.fleeBattle();
  }
}
```

Here's the troll in action:

```java
// simple troll
LOGGER.info("A simple looking troll approaches.");
var troll = new SimpleTroll();
troll.attack();
troll.fleeBattle();
LOGGER.info("Simple troll power: {}.\n", troll.getAttackPower());

// change the behavior of the simple troll by adding a decorator
LOGGER.info("A troll with huge club surprises you.");
var clubbedTroll = new ClubbedTroll(troll);
clubbedTroll.attack();
clubbedTroll.fleeBattle();
LOGGER.info("Clubbed troll power: {}.\n", clubbedTroll.getAttackPower());
```

Program output:

```java
A simple looking troll approaches.
The troll tries to grab you!
The troll shrieks in horror and runs away!
Simple troll power: 10.

A troll with huge club surprises you.
The troll tries to grab you!
The troll swings at you with a club!
The troll shrieks in horror and runs away!
Clubbed troll power: 20.
```

## Applicability

Decorator is used to:

* Add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently, that is, without 
affecting other objects.
* For responsibilities that can be withdrawn.
* When extension by subclassing is impractical. Sometimes a large number of independent extensions 
are possible and would produce an explosion of subclasses to support every combination. Or a class 
definition may be hidden or otherwise unavailable for subclassing.
