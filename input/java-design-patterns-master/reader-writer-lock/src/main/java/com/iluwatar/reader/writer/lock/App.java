/**
 * In a multiple thread applications, the threads may try to synchronize the shared resources
 * regardless of read or write operation. It leads to a low performance especially in a "read more
 * write less" system as indeed the read operations are thread-safe to another read operation.
 *
 * <p>Reader writer lock is a synchronization primitive that try to resolve this problem. This
 * pattern allows concurrent access for read-only operations, while write operations require
 * exclusive access. This means that multiple threads can read the data in parallel but an exclusive
 * lock is needed for writing or modifying data. When a writer is writing the data, all other
 * writers or readers will be blocked until the writer is finished writing.
 *
 * <p>This example use two mutex to demonstrate the concurrent access of multiple readers and
 * writers.
