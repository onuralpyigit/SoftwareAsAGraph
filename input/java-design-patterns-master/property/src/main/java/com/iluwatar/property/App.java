/**
 * The Property pattern is also known as Prototype inheritance.
 *
 * <p>In prototype inheritance instead of classes, as opposite to Java class inheritance, objects
 * are used to create another objects and object hierarchies. Hierarchies are created using
 * prototype chain through delegation: every object has link to parent object. Any base (parent)
 * object can be amended at runtime (by adding or removal of some property), and all child objects
 * will be affected as result.
 *
 * <p>In this example we demonstrate {@link Character} instantiation using the Property pattern.
