## Intent

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction 
process can create different representations.

## Explanation

Real-world example

In plain words

Having said that let me add a bit about what telescoping constructor anti-pattern is. At one point 
or the other, we have all seen a constructor like below:

```java
public Hero(Profession profession, String name, HairType hairType, HairColor hairColor, Armor armor, Weapon weapon) {
}
```

As you can see the number of constructor parameters can quickly get out of hand, and it may become 
difficult to understand the arrangement of parameters. Plus this parameter list could keep on 
growing if you would want to add more options in the future. This is called telescoping constructor 
anti-pattern.

**Programmatic Example**

The sane alternative is to use the Builder pattern. First of all, we have our hero that we want to 
create:

```java
public final class Hero {
  private final Profession profession;
  private final String name;
  private final HairType hairType;
  private final HairColor hairColor;
  private final Armor armor;
  private final Weapon weapon;

  private Hero(Builder builder) {
    this.profession = builder.profession;
    this.name = builder.name;
    this.hairColor = builder.hairColor;
    this.hairType = builder.hairType;
    this.weapon = builder.weapon;
    this.armor = builder.armor;
  }
}
```

Then we have the builder:

```java
  public static class Builder {
    private final Profession profession;
    private final String name;
    private HairType hairType;
    private HairColor hairColor;
    private Armor armor;
    private Weapon weapon;

    public Builder(Profession profession, String name) {
      if (profession == null || name == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("profession and name can not be null");
      }
      this.profession = profession;
      this.name = name;
    }

    public Builder withHairType(HairType hairType) {
      this.hairType = hairType;
      return this;
    }

    public Builder withHairColor(HairColor hairColor) {
      this.hairColor = hairColor;
      return this;
    }

    public Builder withArmor(Armor armor) {
      this.armor = armor;
      return this;
    }

    public Builder withWeapon(Weapon weapon) {
      this.weapon = weapon;
      return this;
    }

    public Hero build() {
      return new Hero(this);
    }
  }
```

Then it can be used as:

```java
var mage = new Hero.Builder(Profession.MAGE, "Riobard").withHairColor(HairColor.BLACK).withWeapon(Weapon.DAGGER).build();
```

## Applicability

Use the Builder pattern when

* The algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make up the object and how they're assembled
* The construction process must allow different representations for the object that's constructed
